# Possible Improvements to Windows 10

## Removing the `Sign In` Button

Windows Hello works well 90% of the time. However, sometimes it doesn't work (outside, have hat on, etc.). In this case, you have to login with a PIN or password. To do so, you first have to hit the `Sign In` button, and then you have to select the `PIN` button or the `Password` button. I have two suggestions. First, why not remove the `Sign In` button and just display the `PIN` and `Password` buttons? Second, why not have the home screen set up so that if physical keys are typed, it automatically switches to the respective `PIN` or `Password` screen? The first suggestion would save the touchscreen user time, and the second suggestion would save the keyboarding user time.

## Adding fixed canvas to OneNote

OneNote needs a fixed canvas option with working print/convert to PDF.

## Adding a slider to the brightness icon in the notification bar.

When you hold down the brightness icon, it offers a button to go to settings. I think it would be valuable to turn the icon into a brightness slider if swiped left or right.
