# Tips for the OU Electrical Engineering Student

## Tip 1: Test out of general education classes

***If you do the math, every three hour course costs roughly $800 in fees alone.*** That's a lot of money. Thus, it is important to:

1. Minimize general education classes by taking AP, CLEP, and PLA (prior learning assessment) tests.
2. Sparingly take non-degree required courses.
3. Choose degree electives wisely.

Theoretically, you can AP test out of ALL general education requirements EXCEPT the Non-western civilization elective. Additionally, it is important to note that ONE of the general education classes MUST be "upper division" (3000 or 4000 level).

For general education requirements you are unable to test out of, take them during winter intersession (save the summer intersession for internships or research). This will give you more time to focus on the important classes during the fall and spring semesters.

Notes:

- The calculus requirement is a little complicated. There are two calculus tracks you can do: Differential and Integral (2914, 2924, 2934) or Calculus and Analytical Geometry (1823, 2423, 2433. 2443). It is best to look at the OU AP Test documentation to understand what is going on.
- Two classes of the same foreign language may be fulfilled by taking two years of the same language class in high school.
- You can PLA out of Calculus III (both tracks).
- AP tests cost $94, CLEP tests cost $85, and PLA tests cost $50.
- If you are a Computer Engineering major, you can PLA out of Programming Structures and Abstractions, Discrete Structures, and Data Structures.

## Tip 2: Plan your class schedule with the degree check sheet and classnav

In a perfect world, all classes will be available every semester with no time conflicts. However, this is not the case. There are two issues to deal with:

1. Time conflicts (especially for upper division classes)
2. Class prerequisites
3. Classes offered once a year

My advice is to always be flexible. You never know anything definitive about the next semester until you begin enrolling in it. Have a list of 5-6 classes to take, and expect several to conflict.

**When planning electives to take, be sure to know what prerequisites are required**. All information on the EE degree can be extracted from three resources:

1. [EE checksheet](http://checksheets.ou.edu/18checksheets/elecengr-2018.pdf)
2. [EE elective sheet](https://ou.edu/content/dam/CoE/WSSC/Degree%20Plans%20-%20Flowcharts/2017-2018/EE_Electives.pdf)
3. [ClassNav](https://classnav.ou.edu)

You just need lots of time to go back and fourth between ClassNav and the check sheets. After a while, you should have a cursory list of possible (and available) classes that you can enroll in, and when the enrollment window opens, solidify your schedule and alter you plans for next semester.

## Idea 1: Just because you are not in a class doesn't mean you can't sit in

There will be more non-required classes offered than you can or need to take. However, you can still sit in a class you are not enrolled in, so long as the professor is okay with it.

## Question 1: What are the best study spots?

For small breaks between classes, I would recommend studying anywhere. For long breaks between classes, the best study spots are the fourth floor of the Bizell library or a back corner of the Fine Arts library.  

## Tip 3: Buy a [box of earplugs](https://www.amazon.com/Howard-Leight-Honeywell-Visibility-Disposable/dp/B0007XJOLG/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1540757473&sr=8-9&keywords=earplugs)

It won't make people disappear, but it will make things quieter.

## Tip 4: Don't buy food on campus

The cheapest meal on campus is a **$3.79 chicken sandwich** at Chick-fil-A in the student union. This is the price you have to beat to win. Instead:

1. Bring food from home.
  - Ham, cheese, mayonnaise, pepper sandwiches.
  - Macaroni.
  - Leftover food.
  - Bananas.
2. Buy frozen stuff from Walmart.
 - Canned food such as ravioli or soup.
 - Instant ramen (just bring water with you).
 - Frozen pot pie.
 - Frozen Jimmy Dean sausage sandwiches.

## Tip 5: Bike or scooter around campus

It will save you lots of time.

## Tip 6: Don't graduate with honors unless you really want to

There is no external benefit for graduating with honors. Good research, good recommendations, and good GPA overshadows graduating with honors in academia and industry.

Graduating with honors for personal enrichment depends on the person. Personally, I would rather use the time and money to take any class I want, such as more upper division ECE/CS/MATH/PHYS electives. Graduating with honors restricts you to the honors class requirements.

## Tip 7: Be on the best terms with the best professors

- For good recommendations.
- For research opportunities.
- For developing personal relationships.

## Tip 8: Take four classes per semester whenever possible

This will give you the best chance to:

1. Really learn the class material, which is very important for subjects you want to become an expert at.
2. Get a 4.0, which is crucial for being a scholarship worthy applicant to top graduate schools. It also never hurts when applying for jobs, too.

## Tip 9: Take Gen Eds during Winter Intersession

Save Summer intersession for internships and research.

#### Possible Summer intersession classes

I recommend using your Summer for research or internships. However, if you have a Summer with no internship or research, you can use it to take some classes:

- As I have mentioned above, save as many general education classes for Winter intersession as you can.
- If it is your Summer before freshman year, you can take *Intro to Digital Design* (and *Digital Signals and Filtering with department permission* if you are gung ho). Taking Intro to Digital Design will get you one semester ahead in EE classes, and it is a very easy class.
- Math classes including *Intro to ODEs*, *Linear Algebra*, *Partial Differential Equations*, and *Applied Statistical Methods*
- *Professional Development*

#### The Best Digital Signal Processing Textbooks

List for the best DSP textbooks after a cursory Internet search:

- Richard Lyons - Understanding Digital Signal Processing
  - The easiest to understand book.
- Steven Smith - The Scientist and Engineer's and Guide to Digital Signal Processing
- Oppenheim - Discrete Time Signal Processing
  - The textbook used in Signals and Systems.
- Proakis and Manolakis - Digital Signal Processing Principles - Algorithms and Applications
- Oppenheim - Digital Signal Processing
  - Best as reference.
- Rabiner and Gold - Theory and Application of Digital Signal Processing
  - Best as reference.

#### Goldwater Scholarship Info (written by some high performing person)

> I received the Goldwater this year. What you listed indicates that you're competitive. I'll list my thoughts on the application process.
>
> 1.  The Goldwater is all paper, no interview. It requires a standard list of research activities and extracurriculars, a two-page essay, three short answer questions, and exactly three letters of recommendation. The application is the same every year. Each university is only allowed to nominate four students to the national committee, which makes its decisions some time in March. Check your campus for its own dates and deadlines. Usually, a little under 1,200 sophomores and juniors are > nominated nationally, and under 300 receive it, with a few others getting honorable mentions. It awards $7,500 for each subsequent year that you are an undergraduate.
> 2.  Carefully, carefully review previous examples of Goldwater essays, just to get a good idea of the style they're looking for (not to copy anything). There are many excellent examples online. My personal favorite is this one essay about window glass.
> 3.  Start on your essay over the summer, and once you have a reasonable draft hammered out, pass it along to other people to review it. I had a draft of my essay done by mid September, though the essay was due to the campus committee in November. By the time it was passed along to the national committee, I had passed it by the editor-in-chief of the scientific magazine I worked for, my PI, the Goldwater committee campus chair, and a previous Goldwater scholar from my university. All of them > provided very useful and diverse feedback. I myself put in countless hours into just editing, especially throughout Winter vacation (after my campus told me that I had been nominated).
> 4.  The essay should be written like a research abstract. Avoid using of the word "I" whenever possible. The committee mainly wants to see how you write as a scientist.
> 5.  Pretty graphs and graphics, that would fit well into a research paper, are nice to include.
> 6.  The short answer questions are not to be blown off or filled out quickly. I shouldn't even say it like that — they are just as important as the essay. They paint who you are and where you are going to the reader. You should not use flowery or empty language. Phrases like "my passion for" and "my desire to help people" are really good at convincing readers that you didn't really think about your answers. When filling out the application, keep telling yourself that the person who will end up > reading it is smarter and more experienced than you are. They can see right through whatever you write.
> 7.  Your letters need to be diverse and research based. My own letters came from the heads of two different laboratories I had worked in, and a third came from a professor whose class had a significant research component to it, and with whom I had done a good amount of work, related to scientific stuff, outside of the classroom setting. All three of them could say detailed and personal things about me without being redundant. I was fortunate enough to have worked with full or associate > professors. If you yourself worked closely with postdocs, try to have them collaborate with laboratory heads (though this isn't so important if you can't make it happen). Meet with all of your recommenders if it seems necessary. A Goldwater recommendation should not be lukewarm. Read up on Yale's or Stanford's guides on nationally competitive letters of recommendation. Getting them is a tricky practice of politeness, intuition, and psychology that I won't get into here, but much better people > have written much better guides about this topic.
> 8.  It should be noted, since you listed this in your qualifications: the fact that you go to a top 50 university doesn't really matter. Take a look at the list of 2014 winners. Plenty of community colleges and smaller schools are there. MIT and Princeton only got two winners, though they both nominated four students. Some schools ranked much lower by US News and World got a much better turnout. I don't know why this is, but I would be very surprised if there were only two students at MIT or > Princeton that were capable of getting the Goldwater. I would venture to guess that, in some cases, the unsuccessful applicants from those universities, upon receiving the nomination from their schools, did not put sufficient thought into their applications before turning them in to the national committee. Perhaps this is because they were self-assured that, being a nominee from MIT or Princeton, they would get it. It may be completely misled of me to say this (there are many, many other > possible reasons), but I am using this hypothetical to illustrate a point: the Goldwater does not go to the most inherently qualified future scientist, it goes to the qualified individuals that put the most effort into their application. The national committee wants to award the best future scientists, but they won't give the Goldwater to someone that clearly didn't put time and thought into their application. Personally, I think that there were plenty of other students from my school that > applied and could have gotten it — and in fact, given the quality of their research and their grades, were way more qualified than me — but they didn't put as much thought into their application or essay at the campus level. So never, ever overestimate your chances with this.
> 9.  "I am going to get a PhD." This is not an ambition — this is a fact. This is the eleventh commandment of the Old Testament, an amendment of the US constitution, and an old prophesy that was read aloud in the Garden of Eden. Carve this fact into your application. You get my point.
> 10.  Internet forums don't usually give good advice on college and prestigious scholarships. Lots of misinformation. I myself almost didn't apply because there were a lot of Internet comments that said "you basically HAVE TO HAVE a GPA of 4.0 for the Goldwater!" (mine was between 3.8 and 3.9, whereas many students with higher GPAs did not receive it). Reach out to other Goldwater scholars and knowledgeable professors at your school, even if you don't really know them, and ask their advice. > Also, the guides published by other universities are all great references. Google is great.
> 11.  That's about all I can think of. Best of luck. Let me know if you have any other questions.
> 12.  I also received the Goldwater (last year). The biggest part of the application is the research proposal. I do think the short answer questions are important, but I spent far longer on the research proposal and went through many drafts with the professor I do research with. The end result included pilot data and graphs and a very clear research plan. In some ways, it's like applying for any research funding. You have to show that you, as the researcher, are well-qualified to carry out the project that you are proposing AND successfully argue that this is a project worth studying.
