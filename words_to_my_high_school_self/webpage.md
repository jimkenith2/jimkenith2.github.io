### Guide to school classes (and AP) for the motivated HS student

1. Arrive 5min early.
2. Sit in the front.
3. Before class starts, review your notes.
4. Ask at least one question during or after class.
5. Take notes. Besides listening to the teacher and writing stuff down, there isn't much else you can do in lecture.
- There are some points to note taking:
 1. Write clean notes. There is no point in writing stuff you can't read. It might take a little effort to write clean notes, but it takes more effort deciphering sloppy notes. Use lots of paper. (I personally use college rule, and skip every other line for neatness and readability. Paper is cheap.)
 2. Writing any stuff, hard or easy, new or old, down gets the stuff in your brain a bit better.
 3. Writing stuff in class saves you time later on if you want to refer back to stuff.
 4. Sometimes, the teacher lectures book independent stuff, which you can only transcribe a copy of in class.
 5. If you find yourself being distracted by trying to write stuff down verses understanding what the teacher is saying, back of on the note taking just a little. Only write down important stuff, and leave sections to fill in later (such as right after class).
 6. Do some hw right when you get it. (Do all the easy problems.)
 7. In summary: if you go to class, take good notes, and do the HW, you will do well in the class.

Why take AP classes and AP tests?
1. AP classes are usually harder so you learn more stuff.
2. AP test scores get you college general education credit.
3. (Also, AP classes/test scores also look good on college resumes, which get you into good colleges.) Thus, when deciding what AP classes and AP tests to take, think of two things:
1. What AP classes (include "self studying" as a self made class) will let me learn stuff that I am interested in learning about?
2. What AP tests can I get credit for at whatever university I will attend in the future? (Think for your fallback school and reach school) a
1. This will also determine what score you need to shoot for on the AP test. Here is my recommended guide to what AP classes/tests to take:
