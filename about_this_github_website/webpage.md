# About This GitHub Website

I use the atom.io text editor (with no extra packages or setting changes) to maintain this website. I write all files in markdown. The markdown files are automatically converted to html when viewed as a website.

All projects, articles, etc. are stored in their own directory. Directory and file names consist of lowercase characters and underscores. The main page of each project is named webpage.md.

Writing files in html or markdown was a design choice I wrestled with. Html is cumbersome to write, but it gives the most elegant file. On the other hand, markdown is simple to write, but the resulting auto converted html file has extra bloat. Eventually, I decided that the extra bloat was worth the time savings.

All pictures have 1600 width and all embedded pdfs have 800 width. This was an arbitrary design choice.
