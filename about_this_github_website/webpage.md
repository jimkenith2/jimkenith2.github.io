# About This GitHub Website

I use the atom.io text editor (with no extra packages or setting changes) to maintain this website. I write all files in markdown. The markdown files are automatically converted to html when viewed as a website.

All projects, articles, etc. are stored in their own directory. Directory and file names consist of lowercase characters and underscores. The main page of each project is named webpage.md.

Writing files in html or markdown was a big design choice I wrestled with. Html is cumbersome to write, but it gives the most elegant file. On the other hand, markdown is simpler to write, but the resulting auto converted html file is bloated. Eventually, I decided that the extra code bloat from converting markdown to html was worth the time savings for myself.

All pictures are have 1600 width and are displayed as fractions of 800 width. and all embedded pdfs have 800 width. This was an arbitrary design choice.
