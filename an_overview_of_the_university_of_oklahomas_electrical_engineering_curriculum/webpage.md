# An Overview of the University of Oklahoma's Electrical Engineering Curriculum

For the 2017-2018 academic year.

Courses can be divided into four groups: ECE required courses,  ECE elective courses, "general education" courses, and ECE required courses that are not related to ECE. ("General education" courses are courses required to be completed by every student at OU.)

## Textbooks Used

The material covered in a class heavily depends on the teacher. However the textbooks used for most courses, especially required courses, stays fairly consistent, and the textbook can give a rough measure of what is covered in a class.
