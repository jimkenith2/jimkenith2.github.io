# An Overview of the University of Oklahoma's Electrical Engineering Curriculum

Courses can be divided into four groups: ECE required courses, ECE related courses, ECE elective courses, and "general education" courses. ("General education" courses are courses required to be completed by every student at OU.)

## Textbooks Used

The material covered in a class heavily depends on the teacher. However the textbooks used for most courses, especially required courses, stays fairly consistent, and the textbook can give a rough measure of what is covered in a class.
