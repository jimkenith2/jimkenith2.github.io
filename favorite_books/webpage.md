| Beginner Circuit Theory | Kuphaldt - All About Circuits Texts (DC and AC)                         | Comprehensively covers the material of a traditional circuits textbook, but is easier to read than a traditional textbook.             |
| Practical Reference     | Monk - Electronics for Inventors                                        | A good reference for "practical electronics". I think of it as a mid-reference between the Art of Electronics and Make/Exploring.      |
