# Black Operating System

A black operating system (where as many colors are dark as possible) has two benefits. It saves battery life and reduces eye fatigue.

How is a black operating system achieved? The easiest way is to invert all white to black and all black to white. Then, as many colors should then be converted to black so long as it doesn't hamper program usage. All elements of the GUI must be optimized to a black theme, and websites must have white and black inverted, with other colors kept the same.
