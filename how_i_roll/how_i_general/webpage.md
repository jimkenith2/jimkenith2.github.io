# How I General

How I do general things.

## Creating Accounts

- Example email: first.last.number@mail.com (john.kenuth.4@mail.com)
- Example username: first.last.number (john.kenuth.4)
  - I keep a list of websites I have accounts for. When I stop using an account, I delete it.
- Passwords:
  - I always create unique passwords for each account and store them in a physical location.
  - I make a 15 character password with a password generator, then hand toss it a bit.

## Writing Utensil System

I purchase four things. These four things will last for years.

- Two pack Twist Erase III 0.5mm mechanical pencil.
- Box of Twist Erase Erasers.
- Pack of Ainstein 0.5mm HB lead.
- Box of Uniball Deluxe 0.5mm blue pens.

I use a blue pen because it is more versatile than a black pen. I can highlight black text and sign documents.

I keep one pencil and pen in my backpack, and one pencil and pen on my desk.

## School System

The school system revolves around the backpack. Any backpack is fine, as there are many different backpacking needs. However, I recommend a simple and light backpack that has a large storage compartment, a small storage compartment, and a water bottle holder.
