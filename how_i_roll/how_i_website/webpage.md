# How I Website

(A crude name for website coding style.)

I write webpages in markdown. GitHub then automatically converts the Markdown page into HTML.

`#` is reserved for the webpage title. The rest of the webpage is standardly organized.

PDFs can be fractions of 100% wide, and they must be 800 high.

`<embed src="pdf.pdf" width="100%" height="800">`

Pictures can be fractions of 100% wide.

`<img src="image.png" width="100%">`

Two pictures (can be applied to PDFs too) side by side:

`<img src="image1.png" width="50%"><img src="image2.png" width="50%">`

HTML syntax is used over Markdown syntax because the picture/PDF width must be 100% wide, something Markdown syntax doesn't do.

I use Markdown syntax for links, though:

`!(The Link's Link)[link.md]`
