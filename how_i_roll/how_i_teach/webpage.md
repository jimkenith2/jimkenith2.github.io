# How I Teach

All documents are written in Markdown and converted to PDF with Pandoc.

Information that changes every year should not be included in the syllabus, homework, or test. Rather, it should be communicated through lecture. This includes:

- Office hours
- TA office hours
- Homework/Project/Etc. due dates
- Test dates

Two homework styles are used. The first is a strict format for only textbook problems. Its only benefit is to save paper. It supports a maximum of 40 lines of homework, and no more than 15 problems per line. The second is a more general homework format.

Homework is assigned every class and is due next class. This helps pace procrastinators and people with busy schedules.

Reading sections of the textbook is assigned and emphasized every class period.

Tests do not consist of multiple sheets with a question on each sheet and space. A more elegant method is to have all problems on one sheet and have students write answers on separate black printer paper.

Two plastic bags are used, a blackboard bag and a whiteboard bag. The blackboard bag contains a pack of medium chalk and an eraser. The whiteboard bag contains a pack of black erase markers and an eraser.

All lecturing is done on board. No slides. Notes are written on white paper, stapled by lecture, and stored in a one inch binder or manila file folder.

A class is taught I become confident in the course material, pace, and lecture quality (not many questions/confusions made, and the lectures are enjoyable to watch). Once that happens, I create an "online" version of the course that includes:

1. Recording the lectures and uploading them to YouTube.
2. Posting all notes, homework, handouts, tests, etc.
3. Make a online course webpage that guides any potential online student through the material.

Then, I start over again teaching a different course, following the same progression.
