# How I Teach

All documents are written in Markdown and converted to PDF with Pandoc.

Information that changes every year should not be included in the syllabus, homework, or test. Rather, it should be communicated through lecture. This includes:

- Office hours
- TA office hours
- Homework/Project/Etc. due dates
- Test dates

I use two homework styles. The first is a strict format for only textbook problems. Its only benefit is to save paper. It supports a maximum of 40 lines of homework, and no more than 15 problems per line. The second is a more general homework format.

Homework should be assigned often (preferably every class), in small chucks, and be due as soon as possible (preferably the next class).

Reading sections of the textbook should be assigned and emphasized every class period.

Tests do not consist of multiple sheets with a question on each sheet and space. A more elegant method is to have all problems on one sheet and have students write answers on separate black printer paper.

I own two plastic bags, a blackboard bag and a whiteboard bag. The blackboard bag contains a pack of medium chalk and an eraser. The whiteboard bag contains a pack of black erase markers and an eraser.
